I think earth is a pretty great place
That's saying something, cause I've been through outer space
I think it suits me, it's just my style
I think I'll gonna stay a little while
I think that strangers are friends you haven't met
I'm blasting monsters and never break a sweat
I'm really thinking I can call this place home
