I THINK EARTH IS A PRETTY GREAT PLACE
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING, CAUSE I'VE BEEN THROUGH OUTER SPACE
I THINK IT SUITS ME, IT'S JUST MY STYLE
I THINK I'LL GONNA STAY A LITTLE WHILE
I THINK THAT STRANGERS ARE FRIENDS YOU HAVEN'T MET
I'M BLASTING MONSTERS AND NEVER BREAK A SWEAT
I'M REALLY THINKING I CAN CALL THIS PLACE HOME
